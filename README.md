# Measuring Perceived Personal Safety in Door-to-Door Transportation

## Overview
This project presents a research study on **developing a scale to measure perceived personal safety** fostered by technology during **door-to-door transportation (DTDT)**. The research aims to assess how different technological solutions influence users' sense of safety while commuting.

## Research Motivation
Despite the increasing availability of personal safety apps and transportation technology, **there is no standardized way to measure their effectiveness** in enhancing **perceived personal safety (PPS)**. This study aims to fill that gap by creating and validating a **Perceived Personal Safety Scale (PPSS)**.

## Methodology
The study followed a **three-phase, nine-step** process to develop and validate the scale:
1. **Focus Groups** – Conducted qualitative research with diverse participants
2. **Initial Item Generation** – Created a pool of 77 items based on qualitative data
3. **Expert Review** – Narrowed the list to 65 items
4. **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)** – Surveyed 223 participants to refine the scale
5. **Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)** – Validated the final **13-item** scale with 71 participants

## Key Findings
The final **13-item PPSS** consists of four major dimensions:
- **Identity** – The impact of personal identity (e.g., gender, ethnicity) on safety perceptions
- **Traveling Alone** – Feelings of safety when traveling alone
- **High-Risk Contexts** – Safety concerns in unsafe areas
- **Interactions with Strangers** – Comfort levels in social interactions during transit

## Results & Validation
- The **Cronbach’s alpha** values ranged from **0.88 to 0.93**, indicating high reliability
- The **CFA model fit** values (**CFI = 0.973**, **TLI = 0.965**, **RMSEA = 0.074**) confirm scale validity
